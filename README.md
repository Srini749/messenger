Once signed in, the home screen displays the different conversations with the user. On clicking, you're navigated to the actual chat screen where back and forth messging can take place.

Finally, you can video call your friends through a video calling button right next to the send button in the chat screen. Agora Rtc Engine and firebase have been used to create a common channel for both the users to join.
